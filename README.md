# Twitch_chest

This script automatically identifies and clicks on the twitch chest.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the following dependencies.
- numpy
- opencv 2
- pyautogui

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install opencv-python
pip install pyautogui
```

## Usage
**I recommend at least python 3 to run this script**
When you run the script, you just need to wait some of the twitch chests appears on
and the program will detect and click on it for you.
On a terminal run:

```bash
python3 twitch_chest.py
```

and if you want to stop the script just press **CTRL + C** inside the running terminal.
